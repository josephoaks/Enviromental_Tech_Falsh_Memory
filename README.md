# Enviromental Tech Falsh Memory

There is very little information on what Flash Memory to use with the Enviromental Tech Void Miner to get which resources from which dimensions. This hopefully will help me remember and others :D

These maybe outdate but as of Minecraft 1.16.5 these are what I have found (also keep in mind, different modpacks may add others!
